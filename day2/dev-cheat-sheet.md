**Examples**

1. Write a Python method to get items from a DB and print them. Leave TODO comments where you are unsure E.g. Data connections.
2. For my Next.js project, write a GitHub Action to check PRs. It should run the tests and lint the code.

## Debugging / Testing

1. I wrote this code {{ CODE }} I got this error {{ ERROR }} How can I fix it? or What does this error mean?
2. Write a test that ensures {{ FUNCTIONALITY }} works for this component {{ CODE }}
3. Write a test for this method {{ CODE }}
4. I am doing exploratory testing, tell me how to break this code {{ CODE }}

**Examples**

1. How can I set up unit tests for a Next.js project? I want to use vitest.
2. What does this error mean? System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Index was out of range.

## Understanding Code

1. What does this code do? {{ CODE }}
2. Explain the purpose of this Python function {{ FUNCTION }}
3. What is the difference between {{ CONCEPT }} and {{ CONCEPT }} in Python?
4. What does {{ KEYWORD, OPERATOR, ETC, := }} do in Python?
5. What libraries can do {{ REQUIREMENTS }} for Python?
6. What language/framework is best for this idea? {{ IDEA }}

**Examples**

1. Can a Dictionary become out of order in Python?
2. What does “global” do in Python?
3. Explain the lifecycle events of Next.js components.
4. What is the difference between Lists and Tuples in Python?
5. What is a library that can render Markdown for a Next.js project?

## Refactoring Code

1. Refactor this code into multiple methods {{ CODE }}
2. How can I refactor this code for better performance? {{ CODE }}
3. How can I refactor this code for better readability? {{ CODE }}
4. Add a parameter to this function to do {{ FUNCTIONALITY }} {{ CODE }}
5. Convert this callback-based function to use Promises {{ CODE }}
6. Rewrite this JS code in Python {{ JS CODE }}
7. Add a parameter to this function to do {{ CODE }}
8. Make this code use Python 3.10 features {{ CODE }}

## Code Review

1. How can I improve the error handling in my Python code? {{ CODE }}
2. Are there any opportunities for code reuse or modularization in my Python project? {{ CODE }}
3. Can you review this code and suggest improvements? {{ CODE }}

## Documenting Code

1. Write a readme file for this project {{ DESCRIBE PROJECT }}
2. Write the Mermaid code for an entity relationship diagram for these classes {{ INSERT CLASSES }}
3. Write the Mermaid code for an architecture diagram for this solution {{ DESCRIBE SOLUTION }}
4. Add some comments in this code {{ CODE }}
5. For this {{ CODE }}, add comment for each step, explaining its purpose

**Examples**

1. Write instructions for running a Next.js project to add to the README

## Tips

1. If you are generating lots of code and it doesn’t finish, type “continue”
2. Give more context, get better results
3. When asking for explanations, add “keep it short and concise”
4. When refactoring code, ask it to omit unchanged code to make responses easier to read
